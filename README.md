# Sleep Tracker API

A minimal Ruby on Rails 7.2 API-only application that provides:

* Clock-in functionality for tracking user sleep durations
* Follow/unfollow logic between users
* A feed of sleep records from followed users
* Cursor-based pagination
* Memory-based caching (per user feed)

---

## Base Stack

* Ruby 3.3.5
* Rails 7.2.2.1 (API-only mode)
* SQLite (for simplicity, easy to swap for PostgreSQL)
* RSpec for testing

---

## Project Structure

* `User`: has many sleep records, and many followers/followed (via Follow model)
* `SleepRecord`: belongs to a user, stores sleep duration
* `Follow`: join table that stores following relationships

---

## Setup & Run

```bash
git clone <repo>
bundle install
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
rails server
```

Run tests:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                  | Description                           | Example Response                                  |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/users/:user_id/clock_ins`               | Create a sleep record for a user      | `{ "clock_ins": [{ "id": 1, "duration": 480 }] }` |
| GET    | `/users/:user_id/clock_ins?cursor=abc123` | Get paginated sleep records           | `{ "clock_ins": [...], "next_cursor": "xyz456" }` |
| POST   | `/users/:id/follow/:followed_id`          | Follow another user                   | `{ "follower_id": 1, "followed_id": 2 }`          |
| DELETE | `/users/:id/follow/:followed_id`          | Unfollow a user                       | (No content - 204)                                |
| GET    | `/users/:id/feed?cursor=abc123`           | Get sleep records from followed users | `{ "records": [...], "next_cursor": "xyz456" }`   |
| GET    | `/api-docs`                               | Access Swagger UI                     | Swagger UI page                                   |

### üìò Example Feed Response

```json
{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": 4,
      "user_id": 3,
      "user_name": "Charlie",
      "duration": 480,
      "clocked_in_at": "2025-05-18T10:48:56.537Z"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "user_id": 2,
      "user_name": "Bob",
      "duration": 360,
      "clocked_in_at": "2025-05-18T10:48:52.743Z"
    }
  ],
  "next_cursor": null
}
```

## Technical Highlights

### Cursor Pagination

* Stable pagination using `(created_at, id)`
* More consistent than offset under high data churn

### Memory Caching

* Uses `Rails.cache` to store per-user feed results
* Cached for 5 minutes
* Cache invalidated on follow/unfollow

### Lightweight & Fast

* No authentication
* Designed for internal trusted usage or prototyping

---

## Scaling Strategies (Suggestions for Growth)

As the system scales to support high data volumes and concurrent traffic:

### 1. **Database**

* Add PostgreSQL for better concurrency & JSONB support
* Add indexes on: `follows`, `sleep_records(user_id, created_at)`

### 2. **Caching**

* Move from memory cache to Redis (to support distributed cache across nodes)
* Use `Rails.cache.delete_matched` or versioned cache keys for smarter invalidation

### 3. **API Optimization**

* Add rate-limiting with Rack::Attack
* Use background jobs (e.g., Sidekiq) for expensive operations like follower notifications

### 4. **Authentication**

* Add JWT/Clerk/Auth0 if this becomes a public API

### 5. **Monitoring & Observability**

* Add request logging, slow query detection
* Instrument sleep activity and feed popularity
